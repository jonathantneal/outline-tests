<h2>Types of tequila</h2>
<p>There are different types of tequila. Each is made in a different way, often with different ingredients, and each has its own distinct characteristics.</p>

<section>
<h3>Blanco tequila</h3>
<p>Blanco tequila (sometimes known as White Platinum tequila) is the purest form of the Blue Agave spirit. It is clear and unaged, and can be bottled immediately after distillation.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Joven tequila</h3>
<p>Joven tequila (sometimes called Gold tequila), is a "mixto". This means that flavouring and colourants are added to it before it's bottled, making it a less pure and therefore less expensive form of the drink.</p>

<section>
<h4>Pure Gold tequila</h4>
<p>Gold tequila is sometimes created by blending Blanco and Reposado tequilas. When this is the case, the tequila keeps its 100% pure agave classification.</p>

<section>
<h3>Reposado tequila</h3>
<p>Reposado tequila is aged in wooden barrels for between two and eleven months. This gives the tequila a smooth texture, and gives it a golden hue in the bottle.</p>
